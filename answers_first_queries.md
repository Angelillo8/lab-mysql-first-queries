7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

The most rated apps are not the best rated apps.

APP                             NUMBER OF RATINGS   RATING
'Facebook'                      '2974676'           '4'

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

The best rated apps have been rated just a few times compared to the most rated; with the exception of 'Bible'

APP                             NUMBER OF RATINGS   RATING
'Mileage Log | Fahrtenbuch'     '8'                 '5'
'Juxtaposer'                    '3610'              '5'
':) Sudoku +'                   '11447'             '5'
'Escape the Sweet Shop Series'  '3'                 '5'

'FreeCell'                      '6340'              '5'

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

Many APPS have a 5 on their rate and have very few number of ratings.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

APP                             NUMBER OF RATINGS   RATING
'Instagram'                     '2161558'           '5'
'Clash of Clans'                '2130805'           '5'
'Temple Run'                    '1724546'           '5'

11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion? (I LIMITED THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THE QUERIES BELOW)

A. A visualization of the most rated apps that are not free and ordered by the number of ratings.
Number of ratings is the closest to a number of downloads or a number of users.
It seems to be that, most of them, are games.

APP                             GENRE           NUMBER OF RATINGS   RATING  PRICE
'Fruit Ninja Classic'           'Games'         '698516'            '5'     '2'
'Clear Vision (17+)'            'Games'         '541693'            '5'     '1'
'Minecraft: Pocket Edition'     'Games'         '522012'            '5'     '7'

'Traffic Rush'                  'Games'         '213092'            '4'     '1'

-- B. Now, let's examine those that are free, ordered by the number of ratings.
-- The result seems to be more varied, based on free apps and ordered by the number of ratings.

APP                             GENRE                   NUMBER OF RATINGS   RATING  PRICE
'Facebook'                      'Social Networking'     '2974676'           '4'     '0'
'Instagram'                     'Photo & Video'         '2161558'           '5'     '0'
'Clash of Clans'                'Games'                 '2130805'           '5'     '0'
'Temple Run'                    'Games'                 '1724546'           '5'     '0'
'Pandora - Music & Radio'       'Music'                 '1126879'           '4'     '0'
'Pinterest'                     'Social Networking'     '1061624'           '5'     '0'
'Bible'                         'Reference'             '985920'            '5'     '0'
'Candy Crush Saga'              'Games'                 '961794'            '5'     '0'
'Spotify Music'                 'Music'                 '878563'            '5'     '0'
'Angry Birds'                   'Games'                 '824451'            '5'     '0'

-- C. Let's make another aproximation. How many of the paid apps are games and how many are not games?
-- For doing this, we are going to, also, determine the number of apps, so we can check how many a free, compared to how many have a price.
-- Alright, now we know that there are more apps free than not free.

NUMBER OF FREE APPS     NUMBER OF NOT FREE APPS     NUMBER OF APPS
'3966'                  '2850'                      '6816'

-- D. But now, we have another question. Based on the arbitrary statement we made before;
-- This is: number of ratings is the closest to number of users; let's change a bit our last table,
-- regarding the number of ratings that free apps have and the number of ratings that not free apps has.
-- Result: In this sense, considering our arbitrary statement, in general, people care about the price. Almost 86% of the "users" are "users" from free apps.

% OF NUMBER OF FREE APPS "USERS"    % OF NUMBER OF NOT FREE APPS "USERS"    NUMBER OF APPS "USERS"
'0.8657'                            '0.1343'                                '91976097'

-- E. But, we are not taking into account why do people decide to pay for an app.
-- Let's make another arbitrary statement: Not free applications have a better development that makes them better applications. So, a demanding user may be willing to pay for an app.
-- If we link this previous statement with another arbitrary statement; this is: users rating is the equivalent to the user satisfaction; we are going to check what is the level of satisfation of demanding users, compared to the level of satisfaction with a "normal user" that is not willing to pay for an app.
-- Result: We can observe that most of the users of 5 rated apps comes from free apps.

% OF 5 RATED APPS "USERS"   % OF 5 RATED FREE APPS "USERS"   % OF 5 RATED NOT FREE APPS "USERS"
'0.7019'                    '0.6003'                        '0.1016'

-- So, answering the question, we can say, people does care about the price:
-- People "uses" more free apps. Most of the people is not willing to pay for an app.

-- F. Let's now trying to answer this question: Does the price matters when it comes to rating 5 to an app?
-- Result: It does not seem to be so. People that uses not free apps rates them very similar to free apps.
-- Note: It is remarcable that almost half of the apps have are 5 rated.

% OF 5 RATED APPS   % OF 5 RATED FREE APPS  % OF 5 RATED NOT FREE APPS 
'0.4396'            '0.4264'                '0.4579'
